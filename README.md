# Tutorial-Work
Basic Tutorial Files on teaching myself python.  If this helps anyone who wants to learn then it did its job.
Self teaching myself programming. 
Career Electrical Assembler/Test Technician with 20 years working in Automation and Test.  After taking automation programming courses for
two years my old job in my old profession told me that I wouldn't even be able to "sniff anything programming wise for at least two years."
I said f it, changed careers, got into IT finally after 20 years of trying with my education and experience and now taking initiative on 
learning IT and making it a prosperous career for me.

Any help is appreciated.  Mentoring is even better.  I am a pretty good henchman/lackey on the side.
